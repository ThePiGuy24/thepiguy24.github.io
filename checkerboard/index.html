		<p>This is a rather basic illusion created by setting each of the colour channels to a slightly different grid pattern (more complex than just that).<br> - Red channel is a 14x16 cell grid<br> - Green channel is a 15x15 cell grid<br> - Blue channel is a 16x14 cell grid<br><br>This overall creates a rather interesting illusion that appears to stretch and squeeze whenever you move your head backwards and forwards, and produces some other interesting effects when scrolling.</p><br>
